[Click to see a live example of a dashboard produced from this setup](https://public.testnet.atomnode.tomoswells.com).

This method provides:

- A <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana" target="_blank">Grafana</a> dashboard visualisation system, accessible at `https://monitoring.<your-node-url>`
- Automatic SSL certificate management for the new subdomain
- Server monitoring and health statistics with <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>
- Log tracking and querying with <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank">Loki</a>

# Installation Instructions

This guide assumes that your node has been installed using Docker. If you are yet to do this, I suggest checking out my <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node" target="_blank">Coti-Docker installation guide</a> before installing any monitoring. This guide also assumes you have the following programs installed:

- Docker
- docker-compose
- git

## DNS Settings

The monitoring system is set up to be accessed from the url `https://monitoring.<your-node-url>`. If you have not set up a subdomain record with your DNS provider, it is likely you will need to do this to make that url accessible.

To do this, you can either add a wildcard subdomain (`*`), or the specific subdomain you intend to set up (`monitoring.`). In my case I went with a wildcard subdomain, and my working DNS configuration looks like

![Wildcard subdomain example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/995792094088155227/1070766780181659668/Screenshot_2023-02-02_at_18.04.48.png)

## 1. Clone the Repository

To keep things organized, I suggest having your Coti node located under the directory `~/coti-node`. We will install the monitoring setup alongside that directory, under `~/coti-node-monitoring`. From your home directory, run

```
git clone https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-monitoring.git && cd coti-node-monitoring
```

## 2. Create a `.env` File

The `.env` file defines important environment variables used to set up the monitoring. Create a `.env` file in the `coti-node-monitoring` directory, enter your environment variables in the following format:

```.env
SERVERNAME="<your-node-domain.tld>"
GRAFANA_USERNAME="<Enter a username here>"
GRAFANA_PASSWORD="<Enter a password here>"
```

where

- `SERVERNAME` is the web address of your node, excluding `http(s)://` and `www.`, for example `subdomain.your-node-domain.tld`,
- `GRAFANA_USERNAME` is the username you wish to use to login to Grafana, and,
- `GRAFANA_PASSWORD` is the password you wish to use to login to Grafana.

If you are unsure about a username, you can use your email associated with your Coti node (or make one up). [Click here for a simple password generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/).

# üèÉ Running the Monitoring Stack

If you followed the <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node" target="_blank">Coti-Docker installation guide</a>, you should have the following Docker components in place:

- A Docker network called `gateway`
- The containers `coti-node` and `traefik` running

You can check the Docker networks with `docker network ls`, and you can check which containers are running with `docker ps`.

## Run the Monitoring Stack

Now you are ready to run the monitoring stack! From the Coti node monitoring directory, run

```
docker-compose up
```

This pulls all of the monitoring software for you and launches it once it is downloaded. If everything goes successfully, you are done.

Grafana usually takes between 10-30 seconds to become ready, so after some seconds, navigate in your browser to `monitoring.<your-node-url>`. If everything is working, you will see the Grafana sign-in page:

Use the sign in credentials you set in your `.env` file to log in.

If you see the following welcome screen:

then congrats, you did it!

# Using Grafana

I wish to cover some of the features that come out-of-the-box with this installation method. These could be improved and extended further over time and I would welcome improvements and suggestions from others.

Out of the box features

- Dashboards:
  - `Coti Public Dashboard` - a publicly sharable dashboard. ([Example](https://public.testnet.atomnode.tomoswells.com))
    - ![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/995792094088155227/1070709166404022344/Screenshot_2023-02-02_at_14.15.31.png?width=1589&height=825)
  - `Coti Private Dashboard` - a dashboard which has a bit more information
    - ![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/995792094088155227/1070497353968128041/Screenshot_2023-02-02_at_00.14.12.png?width=1493&height=825)
- Grafana Datasources:
  - <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>
  - <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/" target="_blank">Loki</a>

While the dashboards are more immediately useful, the preconfigured Grafana datasources will allow you to create your own queries and graphs.

# Useful Docker Management Commands

Take down a single container:

```
docker-compose rm -sv <container_name>
```

Start a single container:

```
docker-compose up <container_name>
```

Restart an individual container:

```
docker restart <container_name>
```

Follow logs of a single service/container:

```
docker-compose logs <container_name> --follow
```

# üßë‚Äçüíª Debugging

This section will be used to answer common debugging problems related to this installation process.

<details>
    <summary>I get HTTPS errors or strange connectivity problems even though everything is set up correctly, or `postgres: could not get migration log" error="failed to check table existence: dial tcp 172.19.0.7:5432: connect: connection refused"`</summary>
In creating this setup, I found that sometimes I would get intermittent problems with networking between docker containers. In debugging, I found that destroying and recreating the `gateway` network would fix this. My suspicion is this is a slight bug/incompatability in Docker, but I am not 100% clear about the cause.<br/>
    Whenever I had these issues, I was able to solve them by running
    <ul>
      <li>docker network rm gateway && docker network create   --driver=bridge   --attachable   --internal=false   gateway</li>
    </ul>
    which recreates the network.

# Contributing

This installation method is stable and works well in my tests, but there is plenty of room for improvement. I have many ideas that have not been explored. Some of these are

- Fixing any bugs
- Configuring alerts (e.g. based on RAM usage, CPU usage, and response times)
- More sophisticated dashboards that take better advantage of the unique information available from Coti nodes
- Monitoring traefik (the web server) and charting response times

Dashboards are especially easy (and helpful) to contribute, as they can very easily be exported from Grafana as JSON files, and all that's needed to make them appear is place them in the directory `config/grafana/provisioning/dashboards`.

If you are interested in contributing to any of these, I would happily take suggestions or code submissions, or make this repository accessible to collaborators.

# ‚ú® Credits

- Credits to the Coti community for the vital support and guidance given to testnet and mainnet node operators.
- Credits to all the organizations who contribute open-source software, making all this possible for free. Namely Docker, Grafana and Traefik.
